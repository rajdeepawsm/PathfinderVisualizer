# Pathfinder Visualizer Using Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm

This project uses Tkinter and pygame to find the shortest path between the source node and the destination node.The project uses Dijktra's Algorithm which lets us prioritize which paths to explore. Instead of exploring all possible paths equally, it favors lower cost paths. It is the algorithm of choice for finding the shortest path paths with multiple destinations. A* heuristic search Algorithm can also be used as it is an modified version of Dijktra's Algorihtm.

How to find the shortest path:-

1. Run the pyhton file. A pygame window will appear.
2. Thw source cell is always (0,0).
3. You can draw obstructions/walls using left muoseclick button.
4. Press the space bar for the algorithm to search.
5. If the cell is not found after searching a promt with "No Solution" will appear.
