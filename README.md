# Pathfinder Visualizer Using Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm

This project uses  Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between the source node and the destination node.Dijkstra's Algorithm lets us prioritize which paths to explore. The project is made using Pyhton libraries such as Tkinter and Pygame. Instead of exploring all possible paths equally, it favors lower cost paths. It is the algorithm of choice for finding the shortest path paths with multiple destinations. A* heuristic search Algorithm can also be used as it is an modified version of Dijktra's Algorihtm.

How to find the shortest path:-

1. Run the python(main.py) file. A pygame window will appear.
2. Thw source cell is always (0,0).
3. You can draw obstructions/walls using left muoseclick button.
4. Press the right mouseclick button on the cell you want to choose as your destination cell.
5. Press the space bar for the algorithm to search.
6. If the cell is found the shortest path will appear.
7. If the cell is not found after searching a promt with "No Solution" will appear.
